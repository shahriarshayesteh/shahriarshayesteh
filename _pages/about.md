I am a first-year PhD student at the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at Pennsylvania State University. I am currently contributing to the [PrivaSeer](https://privaseer.ist.psu.edu) project, which focuses on making privacy policies more accessible and understandable. 

<font color="green">My research interests lie in the confluence of NLP, Human-Centered AI, Responsible AI, Safety and Privacy in Large Language Models, LLM Alignment (RLHF, RLAIF), LLM Agents, and Multi-Agent LLM Systems.</font>

### Ongoing Projects

**Sector of Activity Prediction for PrivaSeer**
- **Aim**: Predict the sector of activities related to each website for each company.
- **Contributions**:
  - **Dataset**: Compiled around 250k website contents with 10 unique industry labels.
  - Developed a method to assign three labels to each summarized website content.
  - **Sector of Activity Classifier**: Fine-tuned a large language model (LLM) to predict the sector of activities for a given website in a zero-shot manner.
  - Released tools and models to the research community to support further research in sector activity prediction.

**Tuned DP-Prompt: A Aligned Local Differential Privacy Approach for Lightweight LLMs**
- **Aim**: Enhance the privacy-utility trade-off in defending against author de-anonymization attacks using instruction tuning and RLHF to align light weight LLMs with gold standard proprietary models such as GPT4.
- **Contributions**:
  - Pioneered the use of instruction tuning to improve privacy-utility trade-offs with smaller, open-source LLMs.
  - Evaluated various models to demonstrate the effectiveness of Tuned DP-Prompt.
