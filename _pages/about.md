> I am a first-year PhD student in the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at Pennsylvania State University. My research focuses on natural language processing and human-centered AI, with a particular interest in ethics, privacy, and fairness in AI systems.

> My research projects include [PrivaSeer](https://privaseer.ist.psu.edu), a privacy policy analysis project aimed at making privacy policies more accessible and understandable. I have also worked on mitigating social bias in semi-supervised text classification during my time at the University of Ottawa.
