I am a first-year PhD student at the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at Pennsylvania State University, where I focus on natural language processing (NLP) and human-centered AI. My research interests include ethics, privacy, and fairness in AI systems.

My research projects include [PrivaSeer](https://privaseer.ist.psu.edu), a privacy policy analysis project aimed at making privacy policies more accessible and understandable. I have also worked on mitigating social bias in semi-supervised text classification during my time at the University of Ottawa.
