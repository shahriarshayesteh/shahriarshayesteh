I am a PhD student at [IST College](https://ist.psu.edu/), Pennsylvania State University. Currently, I am a member of [HLT lab](https://shomir.net/research.html), contributing to the [PrivaSeer](https://privaseer.ist.psu.edu) project led by [Dr. Wilson](https://shomir.net/index.html) and [Dr.Giles](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/). This project aims to enhance the accessibility and comprehensibility of privacy policy documents.

<font color="green">My research focuses on NLP, Human-Centered AI, and Responsible AI, with an emphasis on the safety, privacy, and alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) through techniques like RLHF and RLAIF. I also explore LLM agents and multi-agent systems as a new research direction.</font>

<i class="fa fa-bell"></i> I am in the process of moving on from the PrivaSeer project and exploring opportunities to continue my research in generative AI.
