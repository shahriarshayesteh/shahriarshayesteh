- **Teaching**: Assisted in various computer science and machine learning courses at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and the University of Ottawa, including Head TA experience in Machine Learning and Data Mining.

### General Interests
- **NLP**: Ethics, privacy, algorithmic fairness, and commonsense reasoning.
- **Machine Learning**: Fairness, responsible AI, explainable AI, ethics, and foundation models.

### Achievements
- Awarded a full assistantship from the University of Ottawa.
- Graduated with an A.
- Head TA for the Machine Learning course at UBC.
- Received a full Graduate Research Assistantship (GRA) from Penn State University.
- Awarded a full scholarship for the Mila Summer School on Responsible AI and Human Rights.
