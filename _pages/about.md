I am a first-year PhD student at the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at Pennsylvania State University. I am currently contributing to the [PrivaSeer](https://privaseer.ist.psu.edu) project, which focuses on making privacy policies more accessible and understandable. 

<font color="green">My research interests lie in the confluence of NLP, Human-Centered AI, Responsible AI, Safety and Privacy in Large Language Models, LLM Alignment (RLHF, RLAIF), LLM Agents, and Multi-Agent LLM Systems.</font>

### Ongoing Projects

**Sector of Activity Prediction for PrivaSeer**

- **Aim**: Predict the sector of activities from companies' website content.
- **Contributions**:
  - **Dataset**: Collected around 250k website contents with 10 unique industry labels as the gold standard.
  - Developed a new paradigm inspired by the multi-sectoral approach of the companies' activities to assign the three most related sectors to each website content.
  - **Sector of Activity Classifier**: Fine-tuned a large language model (LLM) to predict the sector of activities for a given website using zero-shot learning.
  - Released tools and models to the research community to support further research in the sector of activity prediction.

**Tuned DP-Prompt: An Aligned Local Differential Privacy Approach for Lightweight LLMs**

- **Aim**: Enhance the privacy-utility trade-off in defending against author de-anonymization attacks using instruction tuning and RLHF to align lightweight LLMs with gold standard proprietary models such as GPT4.
- **Contributions**:
  - Pioneered the use of instruction tuning to improve privacy-utility trade-offs with smaller, open-source LLMs.
  - Evaluated various models to demonstrate the effectiveness of Tuned DP-Prompt.

### Key Research & Academic Experience
- **Penn State**: PrivaSeer - Enhancing the accessibility of privacy policies.
- **Mila - Quebec AI Institute**: Summer School on Responsible AI and Human Rights.
- **University of Ottawa**: Bias Mitigation in NLP - Reducing social biases in semi-supervised text classification.
- **Department of Canadian Heritage**: AI Qualitative Data Analysis on Unstructured Text.
- **Teaching**: Assisted in various computer science and machine learning courses at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and the University of Ottawa, including Head TA responsibilities in Machine Learning and Data Mining.

### Achievements
- **Full Assistantship from the University of Ottawa**: Recognized for academic excellence and research potential.
- **Graduated with Honors**: Achieved top grades throughout my academic journey.
- **Head TA for Machine Learning at UBC**: Demonstrated leadership and expertise in machine learning and data mining.
- **Graduate Research Assistantship (GRA) at Penn State University**: Awarded for outstanding research capabilities.
- **Full Scholarship for Mila Summer School**: Selected for the prestigious program on Responsible AI and Human Rights.
